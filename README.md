# tictactoe

- A simple browser-based Tic Tac Toe game built from scratch using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. This project is part of The Odin Project curriculum and was completed to solidify core JavaScript concepts and DOM manipulation.

- This project wasn't just about building a game — it was about mastering key concepts. Here's what I gained:

- JavaScript Concepts:

  Factory Functions: Built modular, encapsulated logic for gameBoard, createPlayer, and gameController using closures.

  DOM Manipulation: Dynamically updated the game UI and handled user input without using any frameworks.

  Game Logic:

        Managed turn switching

        Prevented overwriting moves

        Checked for win/tie conditions

        Reset game state cleanly

  Encapsulation & Separation of Concerns: Separated UI logic from game logic using clear module structures.

  CSS & HTML:

  Built a clean, responsive grid layout using CSS Grid.

  Practiced styling with variables, flexbox, and a custom font (Poppins).

  Structured semantic HTML for accessibility and clarity.

- How It Works

  The board is a 3x3 grid built with buttons.

  Players take turns clicking cells — "X" starts first.

  The game checks for a winner after each move or ends in a tie if the board is full.

  A reset button clears the board and restarts the game.
